# Creating Your Crew (Zone Reskin)

In the Zone, survival isn’t about lone wolves—it’s about the crew you trust to watch your back. Whether you’re Ecologists in a mobile lab, Duty soldiers on patrol, or a band of mercenaries chasing paydays, your squad is your lifeline. The following steps guide you through creating your Zone-ready crew.

## Steps to Creating Your Crew

1. **Choose your crew size**: Eight, six, or four members (stats unchanged).  
2. **Choose your Zone origin**: Your faction or background (maps directly to Ship Type).  
3. **Create your commander**: Apply the same stat bonus and ability from your origin.  
4. **Choose your squad**: Select roles from those allowed by your origin.  
5. **Select your edge**: A Zone-themed trait with identical mechanical effects.  
6. **Assign your gear**: Choose items from the same categories, reskinned as Zone kit.
